## Projects

### Near-Live AIS Tracking
[Git Repo](https://github.com/mdsmith44/py_qrcode_gen)

Designed and developed a dynamic streamlit dashboard to enable NPS community to build custom QR Codes.

Here we show two common methods for inserting images.

Method 1: Use HTML img tag.

<img src='images/streamlit_QR_screenshot.jpg' alt='dashboard' height=200/>

Method 2: Use Markdown syntax

I tend to prefer the HMTL img tag since you can easily customize height and other attributes.
